# Typing-Speed-Testor

Welcome to the Typing Speed Test and Error Calculator! This project is a Python-based application designed to measure your typing speed and accuracy. It provides you with real-time feedback on your performance, including words per minute (WPM) and error rate.

Features:

1. Typing Speed Calculation: Measures typing speed in words per minute (WPM).
2. Error Detection: Calculates the number of errors made while typing.
3. Real-time Feedback: Provides instant feedback on your typing speed and accuracy.
4. User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for a smooth user experience.

How It Works:

The application works by presenting the user with a sample text to type. As the user types, the application:

1. Records the time taken to type the entire text.
2. Counts the number of correctly typed words and errors.
3. Calculates the typing speed in words per minute (WPM).
4. Calculates the error by comparing the user's input to the provided text.
